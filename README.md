<h2>Recommendations:</h2>

1. **Chocolate Chip Cookie** is the best-selling product and has the highest profit margin.
2. **Fortune Cookies** made less than 4% of total sales and should be removed from the menu.
3. **Seasonal Sales Strategy**: Sales are lower in February, May, August, and November. Run a promo in the middle of each quarter to drive more sales.
4. **Expand in Green Bay**: 31% of sales came from Green Bay. Consider opening a new branch there.
5. **Focus Products for New Branch**: Only focus on Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal Raisin, and White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies for the new branch.
